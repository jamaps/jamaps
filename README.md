Hello there! and welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am a human based in Toronto. 

My GitHub activity is a hodgepodge of geographic data analysis/science projects (mostly using Python, R, or PostGIS) or developing smaller scale web-based interactive maps and data viz projects (recently with Svelte + D3 + Leaflet/MapLibre + Protomaps/pmtiles). Some of these projects are work related, some are side projects. 

Check out my [Website / Portfolio](https://jamaps.github.io/) for a visual library of my hobby cartography and photography projects as well as links to a few other things.

In my day job I do a hodgepodge data visualization, mapping, front-end web development, spatial data science, and urban research at the [School of Cities](https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. Check out our [Maps & Data Visualization](https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/research-type/data-visualization/) page if you're interested in the visual part of this work.
