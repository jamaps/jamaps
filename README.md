Hello there! and welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am a cartographer and urban data scientist based in Toronto. 

Currently I work as Lead, Data Visualization at the [School of Cities](https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/). 

Check out my [website](https://jamaps.github.io/) for a visual library for a few of my mapping and other side projects.
