Hello there! and welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am a human based in Toronto. Currently I work as **Lead, Maps & Data Visualization** at the [School of Cities](https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/). 

My GitHub activity is a hodgepodge of geographic data analysis/science/cleaning projects (mostly using Python, R, or PostGIS) or developing smaller scale web-based interactive maps and data viz projects (recently with Svelte + D3 + Leaflet/MapLibre + Protomaps/pmtiles). Some of these projects are work related, some are side projects. 

Check out my [Website / Portfolio](https://jamaps.github.io/) for a visual library of my hobby cartography and photography projects as well as links to a few other things.
