Hello there! and welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am a **Cartographer** and **Urban Data Scientist** based in Toronto. 

Currently I work as **Lead, Data Visualization** at the [School of Cities](https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/). 

My GitHub repositories and activity are a hodgepodge of geographic data analysis/science/cleaning projects (mostly using **Python** or **PostGIS**) or developing smaller scale web-based interactive maps and data viz projects (recently with **Svelte + D3 + Mapbox**).

Check out my [Website / Portfolio](https://jamaps.github.io/) for a visual library of my maps and some of my other side projects.
